            Gamename is a 2D survival game. The game has a magical theme 
            and is based around exploring, fighting and creating a place to live at.

            <br><br>
            <span style="font-size: 21px; font-weight: bold; color: #dba531">The Website</span><br>
            The website is a side project for me to improve on other skills. It 
            serves as a place to connect with the community and provide 
            information about the game and what I am currently working on.
            The website is a work in progress with a low priority. It's primary function is 
            to provide information. The styling will be worked on after the game is 
            finished, or if I feel like working on the website.

            Gamename is written in a custom made engine in C++ using <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> 
            for rendering. The window API used is <a href="https://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a> and might be replaced 
            with Win32 calls in the future.

            <span style="font-size: 21px; font-weight: bold; color: #dba531">Why not use an existing engine?</span><br>
            I started this project to learn more about programming. When using an 
            already existing engine, your are primarily learning how to use the that 
            engine and how it wants you to program in it. Learning about how 
            to make the components you need yourself is what made me create my 
            own engine.
